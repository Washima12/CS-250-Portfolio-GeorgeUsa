## Essential Questions Reflection

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
I interpret user needs by gathering requirements, asking clarifying questions, and translating them into specific, actionable features. Creating user stories helps break large, vague needs into smaller, understandable tasks that developers can implement correctly and users can validate easily.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach development by focusing on iterative, small improvements. I hope to continue using Agile processes like sprint planning, daily standups, retrospectives, and prioritizing user stories, because they keep development focused, flexible, and efficient.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Being a good team member means communicating openly, collaborating respectfully, taking ownership of tasks, and supporting others. It also means giving and receiving feedback constructively and working toward shared goals with professionalism and a growth mindset.
